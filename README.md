alphanalysis assignment Python Stock analysis

I have added the zip file and have shared the link to github repository as well where all the related files are present. 'Solution.py' is the main python file and 'Output_2023_12_01.csv' is the output fille generated automatically after running solution.py file program. 

To run Solution.py enter date for which to do the analysis and amount, it will generate new output file with prefix given date.

Note: I have used yahoo api, though data for all the provided 'tickers' are not present api but code is working fine for available data.
