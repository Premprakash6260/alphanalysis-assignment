'Solution.py' is the main python file and 'Output_2023_12_01.csv' is the output file generated automatically after running solution.py file program. 

To run Solution.py enter date for which to do the analysis and amount, it will generate new output file with prefix given date.

Note: I have used yahoo api, though data for all the provided 'tickers' are not present in api but code is working fine for available data.
